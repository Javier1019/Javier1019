### About
Passionate about technology and driven by the pursuit of knowledge, I am a dedicated software engineer with experience across a range of domains including cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and data science. I began my journey in programming at the age of fourteen, and since then, my fascination with computer technologies has only grown, leading me to complete a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico.

Throughout my career, I have accumulated practical experience with various programming languages such as Java, Python, Dart, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, C#, and C++. Moreover, I have worked with numerous software development frameworks including Flutter, .Net, Angular, Next.js, React.js, React Native, and Node.js. I'm proficient with cloud technologies such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Digital Ocean, Heroku, Firebase, and Oracle.

My experience spans multiple sectors and roles. From working on improving user interfaces and experiences at L3Harris Technologies to automating processes at Accenture, I've consistently been involved in problem-solving and innovation. At Boston Scientific, I had the opportunity to enhance operational efficiency, while at Freddie Mac, I contributed to enhancing the organization's overall security posture.

In March 2020, I founded Javand Software Solutions, where I provided custom digital solutions to businesses, resulting in an average revenue increase of 35% for 85% of my clients. This experience has given me a holistic understanding of client needs and how to tailor solutions effectively.

My aim is to use my diverse set of skills to innovate, problem-solve, and create value in the technology industry. I'm open to opportunities where I can use my technical skills and knowledge to impact a company's success positively.
