### Javier Nazario - @Javier1019
I'm a LatinX Software Engineer from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. I picked up programmming as a hobby when I was 14 and haven't stopped since. Used to study in University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez as a Software Engineering major. Currently studying in the Polytechinc University of Puerto Rico with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cybersecurity. Currently focusing on building a few Startups for the fun of taking on different types of projects and being able to learn more!
