About Me
Passionate about technology and driven by the pursuit of knowledge, I am a dedicated software engineer, CTO, and AI innovator with expertise in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and data science. My programming journey began at 14, fueling a lifelong fascination with computer technologies. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico and have built a career focused on solving complex problems through software innovation.

I currently serve as the CTO of Intelligent Core, where we develop predictive and agentic AI models for businesses, leveraging a proprietary AI engine that I architected. Our solutions help companies automate processes, optimize decision-making, and unlock new levels of efficiency through AI-driven insights.

I have hands-on experience with various programming languages and frameworks, including Flutter, .NET, Angular, Next.js, React.js, React Native, and Node.js. Additionally, Iâ€™m proficient in AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

My career has spanned multiple industries, enhancing user experiences at L3Harris Technologies, automating processes at Accenture, improving operational efficiency at Boston Scientific, and strengthening security at Freddie Mac.

In 2020, I founded Javand Software Solutions, delivering tailored digital solutions that helped 85% of my clients increase revenue by an average of 35%. This experience honed my ability to bridge technology and business needs to create impactful solutions.
